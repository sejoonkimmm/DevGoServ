# DevGoServ
Rebuilding C++ Webserv in Go with Kubernetes + Helm

## Project Overview
This project aims to reimagine the 42 Curriculum's C++ Webserv assignment in Go, deploying it using modern DevOps tools and practices.

## Motivation
1. To understand the characteristics and performance differences between C++ and Go by reimplementing a web server.
2. To learn and apply DevOps tools and methodologies used in production environments.
3. To gain hands-on experience with Minikube and Helm charts in a practical project setting.

## Learning Objectives
### Computer Science Knowledge
- Network programming fundamentals
- HTTP protocol principles
- Concurrency and asynchronous programming

### Go Programming
- Concurrent programming using Go's goroutines and channels
- Web server implementation using Go's net/http package
- Utilizing Go's testing framework

### DevOps Skills

- Containerization with Docker
- Orchestration with Kubernetes
- CI/CD pipeline setup (using GitHub Actions)
- Kubernetes application packaging with Helm
- Local Kubernetes environment setup with Minikube

### Key Features

- HTTP/1.1 support
- Implementation of GET, POST, DELETE methods
- Static file serving
- Basic routing functionality
- Server configuration via config files
(Additional features...)
